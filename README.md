DX7 archive and analysis

Let us archive the open DX7 sysex files. And let us write some fun programs around them!
A machine language network for generating new novel patches for the DX7?

DX7 is an exciting platform since many plugins and many hardware synthesizers are compatible with the DX7 system. 

For example (DX7-compatible platforms):

Hardware: DX7/FS1R/DX200/TX812

Software: Dexed, FM8
